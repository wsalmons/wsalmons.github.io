			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
			<p>I love to refinish/build furniture. I have sold many pieces of high quality furniture.
				But it requires development and use of the left and right brain. The left brain is able to
				calculate cost/return, quantities, time constraints and schedules, and procedures. The right
				brain is required to judge appearance, colors, creativity and new approaches, and style. The
				end result is what my left and right brain have settled to have an economically produced, high
				quality product. </p>
